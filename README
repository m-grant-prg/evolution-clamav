-------------------------
1 ... Project Description
=========================

The project consists of bash scripts which can be used as filters to scan
incoming mail with ClamAV in Evolution. There is a script which scans the mail
in the foreground and one that utilises the ClamAV daemon.

N.B.
----
At a source modification / development level, this project expects to reside in
a git environment. This manifests itself in 2 places:-
1) ... .gitignore files are included in the source.
2) ... The make target, 'srctarball', relies on the command 'git am' so it will
	fail if git is not installed or it is not in a git repository.


-------------------------------------------------
2 ... AutoTools (configure and make) Installation
=================================================

a) ... Download either the source or distribution tarball (the .tar.gz file)
	from:-

https://github.com/m-grant-prg/evolution-clamav/releases

b) ... Extract the tarball preserving the directory structure.

c) ... cd to the directory created.

d) ... If you downloaded the source tarball type 'autoreconf -if'

e) ... Type './configure'

f) ... As root or sudo, type 'make install clean'

g) ... Determine where the scripts have been installed. This will almost
certainly be /usr/local/bin but can be discovered by typing
'which evolution-clamav.sh'

h) ... Open Evolution

i) ... Go to "Edit" > "Message Filters"

j) ... Click "Add"

k) ... Apply following settings:

		k.1) Rule Name: ClamAV (or anything else)
		k.2) Click "Add Condition"
		k.3) Select "Pipe to Program"
		k.4) Then using the location determined in g), either:
			Select the evolution-clamav.sh file for foreground
			scanning
			or
			Select the evolution-clamavd.sh file to use the daemon
		k.5) Select "does not return"
		k.6) Enter "0"
		k.7) Click "Add Action"
		k.8) Choose "Delete"

l) ... Click "OK"

(Quote marks are for textual clarity only).


To uninstall the package:

1 ... cd to the directory created in the above install process.

2 ... As root or sudo, type 'make uninstall clean'


--------------------------------------------
3 ... Installation of Distro-Native Packages
============================================
Installation packages native to different distributions are available, please
refer to the relevant installation section on the wiki at:-

https://github.com/m-grant-prg/evolution-clamav/wiki


---------------------
4 ... Utility Scripts
=====================
In the project root directory there is 1 helper script; bootstrap.sh.

bootstrap.sh
------------
This misleadingly named script bootstraps the project build and provides other
useful features. The main options below are probably b, c, C, D and T.

In AutoTools it is usually advisable to perform parallel builds. This means you
build somewhere other than the project root. This is because building creates
files and they would confuse the project root downwards. I always create a build
directory straight off the project root, cd to there and do all build and git
work from there, (.gitignore is already set to ignore such a directory).

Assuming you adopt the preceding paragraph then a typical invocation of the
script would be:-

../bootstrap.sh --config --build ..

The last '..' points the way to project root.

For the full list of arguments to bootstrap.sh, please refer to the options
section of the acmbuild wiki, the options are identical:-
